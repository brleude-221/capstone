## Project Proposal: DataFrame Toolbox for Working with Tabular Data
Author: Irena Torosyan

Supervisor: Norayr Chilingaryan

Affiliation: American University of Armenia, Data Science Department

### 1. Introduction

Working with data often involves repetitive tasks on structured formats like CSV files. This project aims to provide a user-friendly DataFrame tool for basic CSV manipulation, incorporating a DataFrame class that offers functionality similar to the popular pandas library. This combination strikes a balance between simplicity and flexibility.

### 2. Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly, efficient DataFrame class for reading, writing, and modifying data.

- Implement essential functionalities like find/replace, data filtering, and basic statistical analysis.

- Explore advanced features like regular expression capabilities and dynamic column typing for increased flexibility.

- Investigate additional file format support (e.g., ODS, XLSX, JSON) for enhanced usability. Provide an interface for loading, working with, and saving the data in various formats. 

### 3. Target Audience

Data analysts, data scientists, system administrators, and anyone who regularly works with simple datasets in CSV-like formats.

### 4. Project Scope

This project will be divided into two main phases:

**Phase 1: Core Functionality**

- Develop the core DataFrame class and parsing engine.

- Implement functionalities for reading, writing, and basic data manipulation (e.g., filtering, sorting).

- Integrate find/replace with basic string operations.

- Conduct testing and finalize documentation for core functionalities.

**Phase 2: Advanced Features**

- Develop a simple regex library for more sophisticated data modification.

- Implement dynamic column typing based on header information.

- Investigate support for additional file formats, focusing on common options like ODT, XLSX, and JSON.

- Conduct further testing and expand documentation.

### 5. Deliverables

- A functional DataFrame class.

- Comprehensive documentation with usage instructions.

- Project report.

- Open-source release.

### 6. Timeline

- **Month 1**: Design, research, and framework development.

- **Month 2**: Core functionality implementation and testing. Documentation and initial testing.

- **Month 3**: Advanced features development and testing. 

- **Until Capstone Defense**: Code refinement and final testing. Finalizing the results in the report.

### 7. Conclusion

This project addresses the need for efficient work with tabular data with a DataFrame-like experience in a lightweight tool. The blend of simplicity and flexibility has the potential to improve data processing and user experience in various use cases. We are committed to developing a valuable tool that can evolve into a community-driven project, benefiting a wide range of data users.
